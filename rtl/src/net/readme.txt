 If you are already reaching this file, I'd like to tell you something more:

  1) The sub-package requires a 3rd open source library superobject.

  2) The sub-package does not include a IPC framework. You might have to use any existing IPC framework, or build it by
    yourself. I do have a IPC framework based on Windows Messaging. But right now I still think it is designed too 
    specialized for my own purpose. I will add it to dutil for sure some time 2014.

  3) For any feedbacks or suggestions, please write me to my gmail 'sx.away'.
