A cohesive and comprehensive library for general purpose usage. 

IMPORTANT: Considering about using the exciting new Delphi language features 
(such as for-in-loop, generic types, advances record type, class constructor, 
Unicode support), our code might not be compiled using an old Delphi compiler. 
You should at least use Delphi 2010.

We write code based on Design by Contract principle. We use many pre- and post-
conditions to assure the code works properly as expected. We also raise and 
capture exceptions in code, which makes the logic of code looks perfectly clear.

We hope you enjoy using the library. We would be very appreciated, if you can 
help us to make it better.
